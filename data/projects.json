        "On June 23rd the IEOA brought in bobcats, a stone slinger, gravel trucks and material to help with the revitalization of the Art Morris Park in Sooke.",
        "Sooke Minor Fastball is a volunteer based association whose primary goal is to give all children the opportunity to participate in the sport of Fastball.  The IEOAâ€™s support of this project will have a direct effect on the families in the community as it helped to keep the registration low enough to invite families into their Fastball program who otherwise may not have been able to afford to participate."
